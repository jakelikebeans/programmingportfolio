# Final Project

# Targets-Shooter


## Description
This target shooter game is a simple 2d game where you have to shoot targets with a gun. 
It is a console-based game that will be created in processing.
I want to include a start screen, a score counter, and an end screen if the player reaches the amount of targets needed.
Additionally, I would like to keep the display quite simple since overcomplicating a display will often distract the player resulting in them losing.
Along with this, I would like to give the player specific instructions on what to do when they win or lose this particular game.
Finally, it is a visually stimulating game with high-end graphics and handcrafted/original images.


# Errors Logic/Runtime
I had trouble getting certain images to render they were in the game but they couldn't display on the screen.
Certain functions also had trouble rendering such as the scoreboard, and the lasers.
Additionally, the scoreboard and function that track actions in the game such as # of lasers, health, and other factors were not developed correctly leading to further errors which I then had to comment on so the game works. However, it doesn't have all of the features that make it a completely functioning game because I had great difficulty in debugging because it was a lot of code.

# Application Look and Feel
The application looks and feels fine, it runs but with incomplete features such as the ones stated above.
